create jar file from eclipse (not runnable, don't worry about main class or anything)
open jarSplice
add jars
-the jar you just made
-plus lwjgl, lwgjl_util, jinput,slick
add all the windows natives
set the main class to packageName.MainClassName
then create fat jar
Put the fat jar in a folder with the game resources
Worked for me.
